# Insights — cross-package

Traps we have already hit, so nobody hits them twice. Append-only: add an entry the
moment something costs you more than a few minutes, and **do not** delete an entry
just because the code moved on — note the date it stopped applying instead.

Module-specific traps go in that module's own `INSIGHTS.md`. Only things that span
packages, or that belong to no single package, live here.

**Format** — one `###` heading per trap:

```markdown
### <symptom, as you actually saw it>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Cause:** what was really wrong (not what it looked like).
**Fix / rule:** what to do instead, phrased so it applies next time.
```

### CI passes on an already-migrated database and fails on a fresh one
**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Cause:** a merge copied a whole generated directory over upstream's instead of merging
with it. The lane that reuses an existing database never replays the broken history, so
only the fresh-database lane fails.
**Fix / rule:** when a merge touches generated artefacts (migrations, journals,
snapshots, lockfiles), resolve them by regenerating or by appending — never by taking
one side wholesale. Check the fresh-install lane before trusting a green run.
